// Game Optimizer - GPU preference and isolation.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. When an app updates to a versioned folder (Claude Desktop
// app-1.52386.3 → app-1.52387.0), Windows' per-app GPU preference registry key is keyed to
// the FULL PATH - so the setting silently orphans and the app reverts to the machine's
// default GPU choice, usually the same one the game is on. This module detects that drift by
// comparing the RUNNING process' full path with the paths the registry names
// (FindOrphanedAssignments, gpu_rows.h), and the window writes the preference again for the new path.
//
// 🔴 IT DOES NOT MEASURE WHICH GPU A PROCESS IS ACTUALLY ON. Nothing in this product fills
// GpuRow::runningKey. An earlier version of this comment promised that it did; adversarial review
// of v0.5.5 caught it. Which GPU Windows hands an application is visible only from inside it.
//
// This file provides the PURE decision logic
// inlined here so it is unit-testable without Win32. All Win32 calls live in gpu_pref.cpp.
//
// The Windows API surface is wrapped by plan and state classifiers that take abstract
// adapter lists and registry values. These form a firewall: the rule remains unit-testable,
// and Win32 failures are caught by higher layers that ask for specific things.
