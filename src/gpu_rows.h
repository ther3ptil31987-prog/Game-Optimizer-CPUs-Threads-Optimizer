// Game Optimizer - GPU Assignment tab row decision logic.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The GPU Assignment tab needs to show the user which applications
// could be moved to another GPU, and which ones cannot. This module provides
// PURE, testable decision logic that separates the business rules from the Win32 API
// calls that enumerate running processes and read their GPU assignments.
//
// The core problem: when a user runs a profile that assigns an app to the background GPU,
// but that app is marked as a "profile game" (i.e. it has an existing profile in our config),
// moving it could break that profile. This module helps the UI show clearly which rows
// can be moved and why.
//
// PHASE 1 IS CORE + CONFIG + TESTS ONLY. NO UI. This file provides the PURE decision logic
// inlined here so it is unit-testable without Win32. All Win32 calls live elsewhere.

//     the main GPU is the picker's target, and this refuses too, so the rule is testable here.
//   - NEVER select a row where isProfileGame is true. Those are games the user has profiles
//     for; moving one onto the background GPU could wreck it. This is the operator's explicit
//     "exclude all other profiles app already existed in our app".
//   - NEVER select a row already assigned to the main GPU, while `skipMainGpuPins` holds - nor a row

//
// WHAT IT TICKS: everything it is SAFE to tick, and the three exceptions are the operator's own rulings, each already
// written down above and read from here rather than copied:
//   - NEVER a game the user has a profile for (`isProfileGame`) - SelectForBackground's own rule, and the operator's
//     "exclude all other profiles app already existed in our app".
//   - NEVER an application pinned to the main GPU (IsMainGpuPin), nor one another version of which may hold such a pin
//     (AnotherVersionMayHoldMainGpuPin) - founder decision, v0.5.6, "Skip them".
//   - NEVER a Windows image or an excluded binary (`system`, gpuwindow.cpp's Row) - never bulk-selected.
//
// 🔴 IT IS NOT AUTO ASSIGN, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE POINT. The main GPU being the picker's choice changes nothing,
// and "would this row actually move" (SelectForBackground's already-correct test) is never asked. Auto assign decides
// what is worth MOVING; Select all says what is safe to TICK, and what to do with the ticks is then the user's own call.
// The BUTTON shares two of Auto assign's conditions all the same, and they live in the window rather than here
// (gpuwindow.cpp, SyncButtons and DoSelectAll): an incomplete preference walk switches it off, and so does having no
// target - with no main GPU defined, IsMainGpuPin below cannot tell a user's own Windows preference from any other row.
//
// 🔴 THE EXCEPTIONS HOLD HERE OR THEY HOLD NOWHERE. A tick made by hand carries autoSelected = false, and BOTH of
// v0.5.7's re-checks - PrepareEdits, and StillAutoEligible inside the guarded write - deliberately skip such a tick,
// because that is what makes a hand tick an override. Select all makes hand ticks in bulk, so nothing downstream will
// catch a row it should not have ticked: every exception has to be applied at selection time.
//
// `listed` and `system` are the window's own facts about the row (gpuwindow.cpp's Row): only a row the user can
// actually see is ever ticked. They are passed in rather than copied into GpuRow so each keeps one owner.

// neither their order nor a path's casing is promised. A tick made for a GPU the picker no longer offers is a tick for
// nothing, so none survives then.
//
// 🔴 A KEPT TICK WAS RE-BASED ONTO A READ MADE AFTER IT (Council round 2, v0.5.6). This kept a tick by path alone, and the
// rebuilt row carries the NEW read's GPU choice - so an application the user pinned to the main GPU in Windows Settings
// between two visits to the tab kept the tick made for the background GPU, and Apply's PrepareVerdict compared the new pin
// with itself and wrote over it: founder decision "Skip them", broken by moving between tabs. The same held for a program
// that became a profile game, or whose main-GPU pin was newly found lost to an update. A tick is dropped then, and made
// again from a list that shows what the program holds now. A deliberate tick on a main-GPU row that did not change is

// on that complete visit, which an incomplete read switches off (AutoAssignAllowed), and the facts compared below come
// from the incomplete read: a lost main-GPU pin it left out compares as "unchanged". Every tick goes, and is made again by
// hand from a list that says the read was incomplete.
// 🔴 ...BUT AFTER AN INCOMPLETE READ THE USUAL RULES APPLY (Council round 2 fix check, v0.5.6). Auto assign ticks nothing
// during such a visit, so every tick carried out of it was made by hand. Dropping those too lost, with no word, the ticks
// of the rows an Apply had just refused, on the very refresh that Apply asks for (GPUN_REFRESH). No default: the one
// caller in the product must say which reads it has. AJ45 pins all four transitions.
